# Introduction to randomisation, bootstrap, and Monte Carlo methods in R

(An intermediate session lead by Brad Duthie.)

These are the files which Brad will use during the session to explain these techniques. You can download them to take a proper look over the notes, slides, and example script/s.

`randomisation.R` is an example script.

`randomisation_notes.html` has comprehensive details which aim to help get you started. View the notes in your browser here: https://stirlingcodingclub.github.io/randomisation/randomisation_notes.html

`randomisation_slides.pdf` is the presentation which compliments those notes.
